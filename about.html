<h2>About Us</h2>
<p><span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Bubble Under </span> is a group of diving enthusiasts based in the
 south-west UK who meet up for diving trips in the summer
 months when the weather is good and the bacon rolls are
 flowing. We arrange weekends away as small groups to cut the
 costs of accommodation and travel and to ensure that everyone
 gets a trustworthy dive buddy.</p>
<p>Although we're based in the south-west, we don't stay on our
 own turf: past diving weekends away have included trips up to
 Scapa Flow in Scotland and to Malta's numerous wreck
 sites.</p>
<p>When we're not diving, we often meet up in a local pub
 to talk about our recent adventures (any excuse, eh?).</p>
